# Caesar-Cipher


The Caesar cipher is a simple encryption technique that was used by Julius Caesar to send secret messages to his allies. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. 

Here is an example of how the Caesar cipher works:

Plaintext: HELLO

Shift: 3

Ciphertext: KLOR
