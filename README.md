# Caesar-Cipher


The Caesar cipher also known as _shift cipher_ is a simple encryption technique that was used by Julius Caesar to send secret messages to his allies. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on.

### Basic difference between Encryption and Decryption :

Encryption is the process of converting normal message(plaintext) into meaningless message(ciphertext). Whereas Decryption is the process of converting meaningless message(ciphertext) into its original form or plaintext.
